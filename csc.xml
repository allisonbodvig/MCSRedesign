    <description>This course is the study of the principles and design of computer networks, their protocols, and application programs. The course has equal emphasis on practical experience as well as theoretical foundations. The course focuses on understanding the fundamental concepts in design and implementation of computer communication networks, particularly on analysis and development of the software architecture of the protocol stack, and network programming. The topics include layered network architectures, network programming interfaces (e.g., sockets), TCP/IP networking, packet switching, network routing, rate and congestion control, Quality-of-Service, wireless communications, and fundamentals of network security.</description>
